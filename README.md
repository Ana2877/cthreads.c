# :computer: Cthread

User level thread library developed in C for an Operational System (INF01142) subject assignment, coursed at [INF](https://inf.ufrgs.br)-[UFRGS](https://ufrgs.br).

## :recycle: Usage

The library is generated as a `libcthread.a` file, located
 at `/lib` folder. After that you just need to link to it,
  and follow the API available at `/include/cthread.h`.

There are some examples available at `/examples` folder, 
so that you can see how to link you against the library.
